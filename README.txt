**pytaglib**
============

|Build Status| |PyPI version|

pytaglib is a `Python <http://www.python.org>`__ audio tagging library.
It is cross-platform, works with all Python versions, and is very simple
to use yet fully featured:

-  `supports more than a dozen file formats <http://taglib.github.io>`__
   including mp3, flac, ogg, wma, and mp4,
-  support arbitrary, non-standard tag names,
-  support multiple values per tag.

pytaglib is a very thin wrapper (<150 lines of code) around the fast and
rock-solid `TagLib <http://taglib.github.io>`__ C++ library.

News
----

See the `Changelog <CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Get it
------

In most cases, you should install pytaglib with
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__:

::

        pip install pytaglib

See `installation notes <#installation-notes>`__ below for requirements
and manual compilation.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    >>> import taglib
    >>> song = taglib.File("/path/to/my/file.mp3")
    >>> song.tags
    {'ARTIST': ['piman', 'jzig'], 'ALBUM': ['Quod Libet Test Data'], 'TITLE': ['Silence'], 'GENRE': ['Silence'], 'TRACKNUMBER': ['02/10'], 'DATE': ['2004']}

    >>> song.length
    239
    >>> song.tags["ALBUM"] = ["White Album"] # always use lists, even for single values
    >>> del song.tags["DATE"]
    >>> song.tags["GENRE"] = ["Vocal", "Classical"]
    >>> song.tags["PERFORMER:HARPSICHORD"] = ["Ton Koopman"] 
    >>> song.save()

For detailed API documentation, use the docstrings of the
``taglib.File`` class or view the `source code <src/taglib.pyx>`__
directly.

**Note:** pytaglib uses unicode strings (type ``str`` in Python 3 and
``unicode`` in Python 2) for both tag names and values. The library
converts byte-strings to unicode strings on assignment, but it is
recommended to provide unicode strings only to avoid encoding problems.

``pyprinttags``
---------------

This package also installs the ``pyprinttags`` script. It takes one or
more files as command-line parameters and will display all known
metadata of that files on the terminal. If unsupported tags (a.k.a.
non-textual information) are found, they can optionally be removed from
the file.

Installation Notes
------------------

-  Ensure that ``pip`` is installed and points to the correct Python
   version

   -  on Windows, be sure to check *install pip* in the Python installer
   -  on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, install ``python3-pip`` (and/or
      ``python-pip``)
   -  you might need to type, e.g., ``pip-3`` to install pytaglib for
      Python 3 if your system's default is Python 2.7.

-  For Windows users, there are some precompiled binary packages
   (wheels). See the `PyPI
   page <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytaglib>`__ for a list of
   supported Python versions.
-  If no binary packages exists, you need to have both Python and taglib
   installed with development headers (packages ``python3-dev`` (or
   ``python-dev``) and ``libtag1-dev`` for debian / ubuntu and
   derivates, ``python-devel`` and ``taglib-devel`` for fedora and
   friends, ``brew install taglib`` on OS X).

Linux: Distribution-Specific Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Debian- and Ubuntu-based linux flavors have binary packages for the
   Python 3 version, called ``python3-taglib``. Unfortunatelly, they are
   heavily outdated, so you should instally the recent version via
   ``pip`` whenever possible.
-  For Arch users, there is a
   `package <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-pytaglib/>`__ in
   the user repository (AUR).

Manual Compilation: General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download or checkout the sources and compile manually:

::

        python setup.py build
        python setup.py test  # optional, run unit tests
        sudo python setup.py install

**Note**: The ``taglib`` Python extension is built from
```taglib.cpp`` <src/taglib.cpp>`__ which in turn is auto-generated by
`Cython <http://www.cython.org>`__ from
```taglib.pyx`` <src/taglib.pyx>`__. To regenerate the ``taglib.cpp``
after making changes to ``taglib.pyx``, use ``setup.py --cython build``.

Manual Compilation: Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure was tested for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 on
Windows 10. Other platforms might require different steps; see e.g.
`this <https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/12/21/compiling-python-extensions-on-windows/>`__
page.

1. Install `Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community
   Edition <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs>`__.
   In the installation process, be sure to enable C/C++ support.
   Alternatively, install Visual Studio 2017, but install the "v140" C++
   toolset and use the "Visual Studio 2015" version of the developer
   command prompt below.
2. Download and build taglib:

   1. Download the current `taglib
      release <https://github.com/taglib/taglib/releases>`__ and extract
      it somewhere on your computer.
   2. Start the VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. On Windows 8/10,
      it might not appear in your start menu, but you can find it here:
      ``C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Visual Studio 2015\Visual Studio Tools\Windows Desktop Command Prompts``
   3. Navigate to the extracted taglib folder and type:
      ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=".\taglib-install"``
      to generate the Visual Studio project files.
   4. Type ``msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release`` which
      will "install" taglib into the ``taglib-install`` subdirectory.

3. Still in the VS2015 command prompt, navigate to the pytaglib
   directory.
4. Tell pytaglib where to find taglib:
   ``set TAGLIB_HOME=C:\Path\To\taglib-install``
5. Build pytaglib: ``python setup.py build`` and install:
   ``python setup.py install``
